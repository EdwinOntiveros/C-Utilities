# C Utilities
This set of utilities were created over many of my coding sessions, to simplify or accomplish certain repetitive tasks
without too much overhead and boilerplate.

Unfortunately, many of this files were lost to a hard drive failiure and were permanently corrupted.
Therefore, this is an attempt to re-create them from zero while improving some key aspects which i may have ignored in
the past such as:

  1. Modularity
  2. Re-usability
  3. Performance
  4. Code readability
